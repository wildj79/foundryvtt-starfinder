Power cables run from the battery slot to the palms of your hands. As a full action, you can install a battery in the compartment or remove a battery from it. When you attack with a powered weapon or use a technological item you are holding in your hand, you can expend charges from the battery stored in the upgrade rather than the weapon or itemâ€™s own battery, provided that the item is capable of using a battery of that capacity.&nbsp;</span></p>",
