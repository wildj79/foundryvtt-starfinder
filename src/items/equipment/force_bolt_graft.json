      "value": "<p>Witchwyrds can create arcane projectiles out of the force they absorb into their hands. You must have the absorb&nbsp;force graft augmentation (page 140) to take advantage of this augmentation, which allows you to manipulate the same energy. The force you absorb into your free hands with the absorb force graft now lasts for 6 rounds. As a standard action during that time, you can throw a magic missile (as the spell of the same name; 1d4+1 damage with the force descriptor) from each hand that has absorbed a missile, to a maximum of two missiles per round, expending the energy. You can throw additional force bolts from each hand that has absorbed a magic missile (maximum of two additional bolts per round), also expending that energy.</p>",
