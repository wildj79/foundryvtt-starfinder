A few of these augmented victims survived and escaped from their captors, and biotech laboratories have deduced far more humane ways to replicate the brain collectors&rsquo; augmentations.</p>\n<h3>Emotion Enhancement</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve had pieces of your brain replaced to inhibit some of your emotions. You can&rsquo;t gain morale bonuses, but you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against fear effects and emotion effects.</p>",
