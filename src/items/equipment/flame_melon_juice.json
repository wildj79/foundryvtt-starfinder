When a flame melon is properly juiced and mixed with a secret blend of spices known only to Luthyx, it creates this curative serum. The next time you take a full night’s rest after drinking a glass of flame melon juice, you recover an additional 5 Hit Points. Drinking multiple servings of flame melon juice in one day doesn’t provide you with any additional benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>",
