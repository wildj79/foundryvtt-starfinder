Batteries have a standardized size and weight, and items that take batteries all have a slot into which they fit, regardless of the item&rsquo;s actual size. Weapons that use batteries list the highest-capacity battery they are capable of using as well as how many charges from the battery that each shot consumes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 80</p>",
