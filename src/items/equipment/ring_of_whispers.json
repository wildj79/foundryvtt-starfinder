      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl00_LabelName\">This simple gold band helps you hear when specific names are spoken. The ring can be attuned to recognize up to five proper names known to you, such as specific people, places, or things. The ring cannot be attuned to words that are not used as proper names. Attuning a <em>ring of whispers</em> to a new name takes 10 minutes, and if the new name exceeds the five-name limit, the oldest attuned name ceases to be attuned.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl00_LabelName\">The ring grants you a +5 insight bonus to hearing-based Perception checks and sense through (hearing), but both abilities apply only to allow you to hear one of the attuned names being spoken. This allows you to potentially hear a name being spoken a room away or even through soundproof glass, but not any other sounds or conversations.</span></p>",
