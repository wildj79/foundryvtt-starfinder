      "value": "<p>As unique forms of corporeal undead who retain slivers of their souls, borais are not easily affected by certain negative energy effects. Arcane shielding around or slivers of necromantically infused undead flesh woven into your heart (or similar cardiac muscle) protect you in much the same way. You take no penalties from energy drain effects, though you are still destroyed if you accrue more negative levels than you have class levels. Any negative levels you have taken are removed after 24 hours without the need for an additional saving throw.</p>",
