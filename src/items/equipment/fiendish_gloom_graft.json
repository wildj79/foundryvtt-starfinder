      "value": "<p>As the descendants of fiendish beings, tieflings can cloak an area in an almost unholy darkness. With thousands of gravitonic light-dampening cells embedded under your dermal layer, you can also weave a similar gloom. As a standard action, you can cause light within 20 feet of you to decrease one step. This lasts for 1 minute, but you can dismiss it as a swift action. Nonmagical light sources can&rsquo;t increase the light level in this area. Magical light can increase the light level in this area only if it&rsquo;s from an item or creature of a level or CR higher than your level. You can use this ability once per day, plus a number of additional times equal to half your level.</p>",
