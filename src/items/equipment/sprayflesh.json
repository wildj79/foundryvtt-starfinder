If you have ranks in Medicine, a dose of sprayflesh allows you to attempt a check to treat deadly wounds on a creature that has already received its limit of treat deadly wound benefits for the day. If you succeed at a DC 25 Medicine check, the next time such a creature rests for 10 minutes and spends a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points, it can instead gain the benefit of your Medicine check to treat deadly wounds. If you are not trained in Medicine, a dose of sprayflesh acts as a medpatch.&nbsp;</span></p>",
