      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Weapons with the <em>conserving</em> fusion preserve their ammunition and charges after a miss. When you miss with a ranged attack roll, your charge or ammunition is not consumed, as though the weapon had never been fired. This fusion does not prevent your weapon from malfunctioning or breaking as a consequence of your attack. Only weapons that use arrows, batteries, darts, flares, grenade arrows, mini-rockets, rounds, or scattergun shells as ammunition can benefit from a <em>conserving</em> fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
