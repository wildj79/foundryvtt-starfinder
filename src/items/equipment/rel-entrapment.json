      "value": "<p>Scoring a critical hit with a weapon with the rel-entrapment fusion forces the target to attempt a Will save; on a failure, the creature is forced into rel-state, temporarily ceasing to exist. Each round, the target can attempt a new Will save; on a success, they return to existence in the same space where they entered rel-state. If this space is filled with a solid object, such as another creature, the target appears in the nearest open space. Targets have a cumulative +1 bonus to their Will saving throw for every round they have been in rel-state.</p>",
