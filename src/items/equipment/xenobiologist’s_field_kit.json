Using a xenobiologist’s field kit grants you a +4 insight bonus to Life Science checks to identify and recall knowledge about flora and fauna, provided you take at least 10 minutes to do so. The field kit also counts as having access to an infosphere for taking 20 on such checks.&nbsp;</span></p>",
