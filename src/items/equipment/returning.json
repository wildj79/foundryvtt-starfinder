A <em>returning </em>weapon flies through the air back to you after you make a thrown ranged attack with it. It returns to you just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching the weapon when it comes back takes no action. If you canâ€™t catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which you threw it.&nbsp;</span></p>",
