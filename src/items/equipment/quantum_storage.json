      "value": "<p>A weapon with a quantum storage fusion can be placed into rel-state, erasing it from existence; the weapon remains quantumly entangled with its wielder, and it can be retrieved at any time. Sending a weapon into rel-state or retrieving it is a swift action. When the weapon is in rel-state, it has Bulk 0, can&rsquo;t be disarmed or otherwise removed from its wielder, and can&rsquo;t be used. If the wielder of the weapon is killed or destroyed, the weapon emerges from rel-state automatically.</p>",
