      "value": "<p>This single-use device resembles a small cone and is attached to a specific package of explosives (explosives have the same price, effect, and weight as grenades). When the motion trigger is set (a process that takes 1 minute) and the package of explosives is placed in a 5-foot square, the motion trigger sets off the explosives the next time a creature enters that 5-foot square. A motion trigger can be disabled as a standard action by someone in an adjacent square with a successful Engineering check (the DC of this check is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; the item level of the attached explosives); failure by 5 or more sets off the explosives.</p>",
