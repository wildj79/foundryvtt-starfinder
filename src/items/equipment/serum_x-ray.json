      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListMagicItems_ctl00_LabelName\">When you drink <em>X-ray serum</em>, a fluid that looks like mercury and tastes like metal, your eyes turn white. For 1 minute, you can activate or suppress your X-ray vision as a move action. While your X-ray vision is active, you have sense through (vision) that can be blocked by 2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal. Your X-ray vision is black and white, and while you use it, you lose the benefit of any vision other than darkvision. In addition, while using X-ray vision, you canâ€™t attempt sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet.&nbsp;</span></p>",
