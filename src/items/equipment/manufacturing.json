      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Followers of the Prophecies of Kalistrade use <em>manufacturing</em> weapon fusions to ensure they are never without ammunition (or gouged by isolated traders for ammunition), even on long trade missions. This fusion often makes the weapon pearly white with gold accents. You can add up to 400 credits of UPBs to a <em>manufacturing</em> weapon as a swift action. When you do, the fusionâ€™s magic instantly manufactures ammunition inside the weapon worth an equal amount (which might mean recharging a battery) up to the maximum the weapon can carry. This ammunition is nonmagical and can be removed normally.&nbsp;</span></p>",
