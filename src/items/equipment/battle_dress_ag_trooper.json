      "value": "<p>Standard issue for soldiers of the Azlanti Star Empire&rsquo;s elite military, Aeon Guard battle dress is a suit of heavy armor consisting of close-fitting ceramic and polycarbonate plates overlaid with an energy-reflective molecular coating. SpecOps armor, designed for use by Aeon Guard specialists, is of the same design but in a lighter, more agile package. In addition to slots for traditional armor upgrades, each suit of Aeon Guard battle dress also includes additional aeon upgrade slots that can be used to house only aeon stones. Placing an aeon stone in an aeon upgrade slot allows you to benefit from the aeon stone&rsquo;s abilities as if it was orbiting your head. In the Azlanti Star Empire, civilian possession of a suit of Aeon Guard battle dress is a criminal offense punishable by death.</p>\n<p>For all its utility, Aeon Guard armor is also highly stylized, designed to impress and intimidate the enemy. The most recognizable part of its design is its helmet, which always includes a blank, full-face mask designed to give the soldier a disturbing, almost robotic look while also making it impossible to recognize specific soldiers. This is as much for the soldier&rsquo;s benefit as the enemy&rsquo;s, as being unable to distinguish one&rsquo;s comrades makes it easier to ignore personal attachment and remain a true tool of the throne. Standard Aeon Guard troopers often have a single aeon stone set in the faceplate, but officers may have a different number or configuration.</p>",
