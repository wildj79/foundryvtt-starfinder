The upgrade includes an obvious camera and microphone mounted on the outside of your armor, and the upgrade transmits everything it sees and hears; it has access to any senses installed in the armor (for example, infrared sensors), but not any unusual senses you possess. The remote monitoring system upgrade tracks your vital signs, and an individual receiving the transmissions from this upgrade can see if you&rsquo;ve taken Hit Point damage as well as any conditions currently affecting you.</span></p>",
