Sensors installed in your hands or feet (or similar appendages) can do the same. When you are in contact with a crystalline or metallic surface, you can detect the presence of other creatures within 60 feet that are also in contact with the same surface, even through walls and other obstacles. This otherwise functions as blindsense (electricity).</p>",
