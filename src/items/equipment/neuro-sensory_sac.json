A few of these augmented victims survived and escaped from their captors, and biotech laboratories have deduced far more humane ways to replicate the brain collectors&rsquo; augmentations.</p>\n<h3>Neuro-sensory Sac</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve had a small, gelatinous organ full of telepathic neurons grafted to the back of your skull or neck. You gain limited telepathy and blindsense (thought), each with a range of 30 feet.</p>",
