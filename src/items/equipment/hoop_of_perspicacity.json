The interior of the band is etched with magical runes that telepathically warn you before you commit a social misstep, which includes any action that would increase the DCs of Diplomacy checks to alter the attitudes of those around you or worsen the attitude of a person that you consider important. You acquire this information prior to acting or speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>",
