      "value": "<p>The iridias have long offered advanced technologies to the species of the Material Plane. The machine telepathy cluster is among the most common, as it allows the user to interface with technology&mdash;and spectra&mdash;telepathically. This both facilitates communication with the strange outsiders and grants creatures an increased ability to create technological marvels of their own.</p>\n<p>This clump of artificial synapses allows you to attempt&nbsp;Computers checks to access unsecured systems (or systems to which you already have access) within 10 feet. You can&rsquo;t use this augmentation to attempt any other Computers checks. You can also communicate with spectra within 50 feet as though you had the spectra&rsquo;s machine telepathy special ability, and when crafting items that require Computers or Engineering, you treat your number of ranks in those skills as 1 higher.</p>",
