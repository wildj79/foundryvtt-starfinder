The new target must be adjacent to you and within line of sight and line of effect of the original attacker. The DC for this check is equal to either 10 + the attacker’s total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the attacker’s CR, whichever is greater. You can’t take 10 on this check. If you succeed, the original attacker rerolls the attack roll (see page 243) with the same bonuses against the appropriate Armor Class of the new target.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">Once a creature has observed you use this feat, even if that creature is neither the attacker nor the new target, you can’t use this feat to attempt to redirect attacks from that creature for 24 hours.</span></p>",
