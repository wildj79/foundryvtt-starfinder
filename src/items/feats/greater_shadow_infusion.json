This benefit can&rsquo;t reduce damage from effects that deal full damage to incorporeal creatures. You can use this benefit once per day. After that, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to use it again. If your attempt to use this ability fails to reduce the damage you take, you don&rsquo;t expend its use or the Resolve Point.</span></p>",
