As a move action, you move up to half your land speed, ignoring diffifficult terrain. If you use Athletics to jump during this movement, you do so as if you had taken a 10-foot running start (even if you didn&rsquo;t), and you gain a +4 bonus to the check. Until the end of your turn, you count as being in both your original position and your position at the end of your movement to determine flflanking, allowing you to potentially gain the benefifits of flflanking when you face an enemy by yourself. You can&rsquo;t use tidal surge and stellar rush in the same turn.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re attuned or fully attuned, you can either move up to your full land speed or choose one opponent you can see when you use this revelation. If you choose an opponent, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
