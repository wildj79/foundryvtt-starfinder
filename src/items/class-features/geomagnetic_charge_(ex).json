The next time you hit with that weapon before the end of your next turn, you deal additional damage equal to the reduction provided by your electromagnetic deflection. You must be at least 8th level and have the electromagnetic deflection and @Compendium[sfrpg.class-features.xcIBsW8VL3DD9rVU]{Energy Shield (Ex)} mechanic tricks to learn this trick.</p>",
