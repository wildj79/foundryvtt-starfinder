To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 mechanic levels you have beyond 7th. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Armor: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a suit of armor’s EAC and KAC for 1 minute.</li>\n        <li>Weapon: You grant a +2 enhancement bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.</li>\n        <li>Damaged Ship: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship’s base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See page 292 for more on ship construction and page 320 for more on damage to ships.</li>\n        </ul>",
