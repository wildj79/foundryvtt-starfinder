      "value": "<p>You detect all technological items (even hybrid items) with charges or that replenish charges in the area, including batteries, power cells, and generators (as well as such items that are on creatures you can see, even if the creatures have hidden those items on themselves). You can’t determine if there are technological items in areas you can’t see, nor can you detect technological traps in this way.</p>\n<p>The information this spell provides allows you to differentiate between charged items and items that replenish charges, but it does not provide any further information nor does it tell you, for example, how many charges an item currently has or how many maximum charges it can hold. This spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.</p>",
