      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To use&nbsp;shadow walk, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature or vehicle you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real.<br><br>All targets affected must be in direct contact with one another. A Large target counts as two Medium targets, a Huge target counts as four Medium targets, and so forth. Creatures you transport this way can opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if the creatures are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect.<br><br>In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 200 miles per hour. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no saving throw).<br><br>Shadow walk&nbsp;can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow (except for @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}), but this usage requires you to travel across the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality, which takes 1d4 hours.</p>",
