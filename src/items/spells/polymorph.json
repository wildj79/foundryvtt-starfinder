Each time you gain a character level, you can change which forms you have available.<br /><br />You choose which of these predetermined polymorph forms the target changes into each time you cast the spell.<br /><br /><strong>1st:</strong> Casting&nbsp;polymorph&nbsp;as a 1st-level spell allows you to transform the target into one of the four 1st-level polymorphed forms you know.
