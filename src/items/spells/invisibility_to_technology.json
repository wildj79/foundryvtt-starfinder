      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The target and its gear cannot be detected by cameras, motion detectors, technological armor upgrades such as infrared sensors, biotech and cybernetic eyes or ears, or other technological devices, and it is invisible to constructs with the technological subtype. The target is missing from technological images captured while the spell lasts, security cameras do not display the target, microphones pick up no sounds the target makes, and the target cannot trigger technological traps. This spell creates disadvantages for the target, as well. Talking on a comm unit is impossible while subjected to this spell, and automatic doors do not open for the target.<br>Items dropped, put down, or thrown by the target become visible to technology. Items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or a bag carried by the target. Light remains visible to technology, but a source of light might be invisible. If any part of an item the target carries extends more than 10 feet from the target, that part becomes visible to technology. This spell ends under the same circumstances as an invisibility spell.</p>",
