      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.<br /><br />When you cast mirror image, it creates [[1d4]] figment images. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack hits, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss, and an attack that misses you due to a miss chance also destroys an image. Area spells and effects that don&rsquo;t require an attack roll affect you normally and don&rsquo;t destroy any of your figments. Spells with a range of touch are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.<br /><br />An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect. Blindsense doesn&rsquo;t help distinguish the figments from the real you, but blindsight is sufficient to do so.</p>",
