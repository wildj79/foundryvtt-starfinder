If the primary target fails or forfeits its saving throw, its appearance, scent, sounds, and mannerisms change to match those of the secondary target.</p>\n<p>As long as the two targets are of the same size category, they are indistinguishable. As a consequence, if the targets are adjacent and a creature takes an action that would affect one of the targets (such as an attack, a targeted spell, or an area effect), that action has a 50% chance of affecting the other target instead. Any action that would affect both creatures affects them both normally.</p>\n<p>This spell doesn&rsquo;t deceive creatures under the effects of true seeing. Likewise, a creature that can&rsquo;t perceive one of the targets isn&rsquo;t fooled by this spell (even if the spell fooled that creature earlier), and its attacks, targeted spells, and other actions affect targets as normal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
