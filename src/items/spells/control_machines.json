You can issue commands to any number of controlled constructs on your turn, beginning when you cast this spell, as part of the concentration required to sustain its duration (a standard action).<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">If any of the constructs are under the control of a hostile creature, that controlling creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to this spell’s) to negate this spell’s effect. Each construct under the control of another creature grants its controlling creature a separate saving throw to negate the effect for that construct.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While this spell is in effect, the affected constructs follow any command you give them, even if it would be dangerous to the controlled constructs. At the end of the spell, the constructs revert to their normal behavior. If they are intelligent, they know and remember that you used magic to control them.</span></p>",
